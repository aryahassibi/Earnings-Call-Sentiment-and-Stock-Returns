All participants are currently in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will have a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Monica Vinay. Please proceed. Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Myers Industries first quarter 2020 earnings call. I'm Monica Vinay, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer at Myers Industries. Joining me today are Mike McGaugh, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Brackman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us on the call today and available to answer questions are Mike Valentino, Group President, Material Handling; and Chris DuPaul, Group President, Distribution. Earlier this morning, we issued a news release outlining the financial results for the first quarter of 2020. If you've not yet received a copy of the release, you can access it on our website at www.myersindustries.com. It's under the Investor Relations tab. This call is also being webcast on our website and will be archived along with the transcript of the call shortly after this event. Before I turn the call over to Mike, I would like to remind you that we may make some forward-looking statements during the course of this call. These comments are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based on management's current expectations and involve risks, uncertainties, and other factors, which may cause results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Further information concerning these risks, uncertainties, and other factors is set forth in the company's periodic SEC filings and may be found in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mike McGaugh. President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'm privileged to be with you today for my first earnings call as the CEO of Myers Industries. Before we go into our first quarter overview, I want to thank Andrean Horton for her leadership as Interim President and CEO during the transition period. We will continue to benefit from Andrean's contributions to our team as she returns to her role as Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, and Secretary. I also want to thank the leadership team and our employees for keeping the company moving forward during this interim phase, which had additional and unexpected challenges related to COVID-19. Well done, team. I'd like to spend a few minutes to tell you about my background and what attracted me to Myers. I was fortunate to have had nearly 25 years with the Dow Chemical Company with significant experience in polymers and plastics. I had the opportunity to lead several business units and functions around the world and spent significant time leading business portfolios focused on growth and on innovation. Also at Dow, I worked extensively in M&A and in integration. These experiences will be helpful as Myers executes on its strategy, which includes organic growth and bolt-on M&A. Most recently, I've spent two years as Chief Operating Officer at BMC Stock Holdings, a manufacturer and distributor of building products focused on growth and innovation, continuous improvement, bolt-on M&A, and gaining a competitive advantage through its people-centric culture. The strategic pillars at BMC align very well with the initiatives we have underway at Myers. I was attracted to Myers because it's a solid, well-operated company with significant opportunities and a strong balance sheet. We have high-quality products, leading market share positions, and exciting potential for long-term growth. Since arriving, I've also been impressed with the talent and commitment in our organization. Throughout the COVID crisis, our employees have remained dedicated to serving our customers while ensuring their own safety. Our people are our most important asset, and we are leading the company accordingly. Now, if you'll turn to slide three of the presentation, we'll share an overview of first quarter 2020. Demand in some of our end markets was soft for much of the first quarter. We had anticipated weakness in food and beverage and vehicle end markets but did not anticipate that the auto aftermarket and industrial end markets would be as soft. During the month of March, our businesses were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. On the negative side, we saw demand further decline in the auto aftermarket and industrial distribution end markets. On the positive side, demand increased in our consumer end market as customers began buying more fuel containers. The combination of all these factors led to a 12% decline in sales for the quarter. As we noted in our earnings release, despite the current challenges and demand environment I just outlined, our team continued to deliver gross margin expansion. Adjusted gross profit margin increased from 32.9% a year ago to 34.8% for the first quarter of 2020. This was due to solid operational execution and overall favorable margin expansion, which more than offset the lower sales volume during the quarter. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $0.22 per diluted share compared with $0.23 for the first quarter of 2019. Regarding our balance sheet, it remains strong. And we have significant liquidity to support our operations and our growth initiatives, including $73.2 million in cash and $194.2 million available under our revolving credit facility as of March 31st, 2020. Looking forward, we will continue our focus on executing our strategy to deliver profitable revenue growth. We have the plans and investments in place to capitalize on our competitive advantages. In the short term, our priorities are to ensure the ongoing safety of our employees as we continue to manufacture and distribute the essential products our customers require, including material handling containers for food processing, and healthcare facilities, portable fuel containers for consumers, and tire repair products for truck fleet companies. To accomplish this, we've implemented a pandemic preparedness and response plan. It includes working remotely where possible, social distancing, increased cleaning protocols, and a pay program for employees being tested or quarantined. We are developing and refining contingency plans to help mitigate potential risks to the business and to capitalize on opportunities as we move through the next few months. And as we look forward, we will be implementing a return to work plan to ensure the continued safety of our employees, our communities, and our customers. Our entire team is dedicated to staying safe. We are confident that our company has the financial strength, the high-quality products, and the right growth strategies to emerge stronger when the crisis subsides. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for more details on our first quarter financial results and a discussion of our outlook on sales trends. Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. Today, I'll review our 2020 first quarter financial performance as well as our updated sales outlook and full year guidance. Please note that all numbers in the presentation reflect continuing operations. Please turn to slide four. Net sales for the first quarter were $122 million, a decrease of 12% compared with the first quarter of 2019. The increase we saw from the Tuffy acquisition in the Distribution segment was more than offset by a sales decline in the Material Handling segment. Adjusted gross profit margin increased 190 basis points to 34.8%. This was primarily due to favorable price cost margin. Our adjusted operating income decreased 4% to $11.7 million for the quarter. However, the adjusted operating income margin increased 80 basis points to 9.6% despite the lower sales volume. This was the result of the higher gross profit margin as well as a decrease in adjusted SG&A year-over-year due primarily to lower variable compensation costs and savings from the Distribution segment's transformation initiatives. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.22 compared to $0.23 for the first quarter of 2019. Now, let's turn to slide five for an overview of our performance by business segment in the first quarter. In the Material Handling Segment, net sales decreased by 18.3% as sales declines in the food and beverage, vehicle, and industrial end markets were only partially offset by a sales increase in the consumer end market. However, the overall lower sales volume was partially offset by favorable price cost margin and lower variable incentive compensation costs. The segment's adjusted operating income margin increased to 18% compared with 16.8% for the first quarter of last year. In the Distribution segment, the August 2019 acquisition of Tuffy Manufacturing led to a 5.6% increase in 2020 first quarter net sales over last year. As Mike mentioned earlier, sales have dropped off significantly in this market since the middle of March. Adjusted operating income increased to $1.9 million for the first quarter of this year compared with $1.1 million a year ago as our transformation actions continued to deliver cost savings. The segment's adjusted operating income margin was 4.9% compared with 3.1% for the first quarter of 2019. Turning to slide six, I'll review our balance sheet and cash flow. For the first quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of $2.5 million compared with $2.4 million last year. Working capital as a percent of sales at the end of the first quarter was 7.9%, which was higher than previous quarters. The increase in working capital was primarily due to higher inventory and accounts receivable balances. Cash on the balance sheet at the end of the first quarter was $73 million, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.2 times. Now, let's turn to slide seven for our updated 2020 end market outlook. Based on current and projected market conditions and our best estimation at this time of the potential impacts of COVID-19, around which there is a lot of uncertainty. We now anticipate that sales will decline approximately 10% year-over-year in 2020. We also anticipate that sales in the second quarter will decline approximately 20%, with 60% of the decline coming from the Material Handling and the remainder from Distribution. Let's review our current outlook for each of our end markets. Starting with our consumer end market, during the first quarter, we saw an increase in end market demand that was further boosted by COVID-19. As a result, we continue to expect for the full year that this market will be up low single digits. We remain optimistic about our food and beverage end market despite a sales decline in the first quarter and an expected decline in the second quarter as well. For the year, we now anticipate sales will be up mid-single-digits which is down slightly from our previous outlook of high single digits because last year's demand was unfavorably impacted by a late spring season and customer consolidations. We anticipate increased demand for seed boxes in the upcoming seed season, which, as a reminder, occurs Q4 2020 to Q1 2021. Turning to our vehicle end market, while sales to RV customers were up during the first couple of months of the year, they started to decline in margin and have continued to decline during the second quarter. As expected, sales to automotive OEMs decreased during the first quarter. This was due to a weaker global vehicle environment and the impact of COVID-19. We expect a weaker environment to continue. We also expect there will be fewer new model launches this year. As a result of the anticipated full year decline in both RV and automotive customer sales, we now expect vehicle end market sales to be down double-digits in 2020 compared with our previous outlook of down low single-digits. In our industrial end market, sales to our industrial manufacturing customers were soft during the entire first quarter, while sales to our industrial distribution customers, including e-commerce sales, softened toward the end of March as a result of COVID-19 and a shift in demand to health and safety products. We expect the soft demand environment in industrial manufacturing to continue throughout 2020 and as a result, have updated our industrial end market outlook to be down low teens compared with our previous outlook above low single-digits. Finally, in our auto aftermarket, we are now forecasting sales to be down high single digits versus our previous outlook of up low teens. Demand in this end market was soft most of the first quarter, but really dropped off the last two weeks of March. We expect this weakness to continue and more than offset the incremental sales from the August 2019 Tuffy acquisition. Turning to slide eight, you can see our guidance for 2020. As noted in our press release, due to the uncertainty related to the duration and extent of the potential impacts from COVID-19, we have withdrawn our EPS guidance. As I just discussed, we anticipate sales for the full year of 2020 will be down approximately 10%. We also anticipate that sales in the second quarter will decline approximately 20%, with 60% of the decline coming from Material Handling and the remainder from Distribution. We continue to expect depreciation and amortization will be approximately $21 million and capital expenditures will be roughly $15 million. Lastly, we anticipate an effective tax rate of 27% and a diluted share count of 36 million shares. With that, we will now open the line to questions. Operator: Our first question comes from Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Analyst: Yeah, good morning, Mike, Kevin and Monica. I guess the first off, part of the revenue guidance, we're down 10% for the year, I guess you expect consumer and food and beverage to be up a little bit, and there's obviously some benefit from easier year-over-year comps. But I guess, can you just talk a little bit about how much visibility you have just on that demand that you expect for the year? President and Chief Executive Officer: Tyler, Michael McGaugh here. Good to meet you over the telephone. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. I've been here for about a month now. I'm actually finding my way and learning our business, listening, meeting with a lot of our associates, unfortunately, because of the pandemic that slowed up some of the opportunity to visit our facilities and meet our customers, meet our suppliers. That will be underway as soon as possible. So, with that question, I do have Mike Valentino here, who is the Group President of that segment. So let me pass it over to Mike. Group President, Material Handling: Thanks Mike. Good morning Tyler. As you know, and we've talked about this in the past, we tend to get visibility into the upcoming ag season in the third quarter and the upcoming ag season is a fourth quarter, first quarter business. So, we anticipate having greater visibility into that, I'd say, mid to late third quarter of this year. And we're, as Kevin mentioned, I think, in his comments, we're somewhat optimistic based on the fact that we're coming out of a soft season last year due to the late planting and the wet spring weather. On the consumer end market side, I think Mike McGaugh mentioned this in his comments. I mean, we saw a pretty good impact tied to COVID-19 for revenue related to those markets. And then we're benefiting from an earlier start to the spring season this year. And as you know, again, that market was impacted by the slow start in wet spring last year as well. So, right now, we've got pretty fair visibility into the consumer end market, and we'll have a better visibility in the food and beverage side in mid to late Q3. Analyst: Great. No, that's helpful. And then just with price cost, I guess, especially sort of Material Handling, it was a benefit last year, it seems like to be a benefit this quarter. I guess, could you talk a little bit about what drove it this quarter, I think some of the benefits to tail off this year. And then I guess given where resins are, is there any initial thoughts on what that type of benefit it could be for the year? Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, I mean, it was primarily driven by lower raw material costs. And we do expect the benefit the year-over-year benefit to start to tail off. So, we received a significant year-over-year benefit from price cost margin in 2019. And again, in Q1, we expect the favorability to continue, but at a declining rate. It won't be as significant as it was in Q1 for the remainder of 2020. Analyst: Great. And then just as a final question. I think, Mike, you mentioned in your opening remarks, I think you're sort of looking at sort of bolt-on M&A and that potential. I mean, is that something should we expect that to maybe sort of be put on hold for a little bit, just sort of as you deal with uncertainties from COVID-19 or is that something that sort of you're kind of looking at sort of currently? President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Sure, Tyler. It remains part of our strategy. It remains part of our focus. We continue to be active in the market. We continue to evaluate opportunities and anticipate over the next quarter or two, more opportunities may emerge. But it's got to be the right deal, right time, and of course, at the right price. Analyst: Got you, perfect. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Chan with Baird. Analyst: Hi good morning, everyone, and welcome Mike McGaugh. President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. Analyst: Yes, maybe stepping back from the current environment for a minute here. Mike, you mentioned in your remarks some opportunities that you see at Myers. Could you talk a little bit about what those are? I know you mentioned M&A just a minute ago. But and maybe elaborate a little on that? And how are you sort of balancing sort of the longer-term vision with sort of the near-term environment here? President and Chief Executive Officer: Josh, yes, I'm happy to answer that. What I found at Myers so far is our business units are well operated and operated with a lot of discipline. So, that's a positive. What I'd like to do is help us find a way organically to grow more in addition to the bolt-on M&A. And so there's a number of processes that we have underway. I hope to bring in some additional focus on growth, organic growth. From my perspective, being here for a month, the company is well poised for that. Our businesses have great market share. We have good leaders running them. They're well disciplined. And now I'd like to find a way to turbocharge that growth, and I'm working with the unit leaders to do that. So a lot of processes underway and I think there's just more to come there. Analyst: All right. That's good to hear. So, appreciating that you didn't give EPS guidance for the year. I guess could you maybe walk through some of the moving pieces in terms of how we should think about margins maybe in Material Handling? What's the typical volume decremental you'd expect from the business and how does raw material and kind of cost control initiatives kind of factor into that? President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, Kevin discussed the resin aspect briefly. I believe my experience in that area will benefit the company. We will continue to proactively manage procurement and aim to maintain our margins as much as possible. For more detailed insights beyond the resin topic, I'll let Kevin provide additional comments. Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. So, when I think about margin, in 2019, we had a 9% decline in revenue, but we were still able to expand our operating margin. And I'm talking across the company because my comments will apply to both segments. The reason we were able to do that, there were three significant year-over-year benefits in 2019. One was price cost margin that I talked about. Second was incentive compensation, and third was a restructuring action that we completed in March of 2019 in our Distribution business. And so we received or realized three quarters of year-over-year benefits in 2019. When I look at 2020, all three of those items should continue to be favorable year-over-year, but not nearly as significant as they were in 2019. So, that's true of both price cost margin and incentive compensation. And then the restructuring actions, obviously, we realized three quarters in 2019, which only leaves one quarter, which was the first quarter of this year as far as year-over-year benefit. So, for that reason, I think our ability to expand or even maintain operating margin is going to be a lot more challenging in 2020 with another 10% revenue decline that we're currently forecasting. So, that's how I'm looking at margin and why we've been able to consistently expand margin despite lower revenue in the past. But I think that's going to start to become a lot more challenging over the remainder of 2020. Analyst: Okay. Yes. That's very helpful color. And then my last question, I think it's just sort of regarding your outlook for the year in, I guess, in both businesses. Basically, is there any kind of verticals where you're expecting a return to growth in the second half? I know you mentioned food and beverage and that makes sense. But sort of how are you thinking about the trajectory into other businesses? President and Chief Executive Officer: Josh, good question. And there's just a lot of uncertainty. I'm sure you've heard that time and again over the course of these calls. We're doing our plans. We're putting together and building off of our growth strategies, growth tactics customer by customer. We're looking to, if we can, gain share, use our financial strength, use the horsepower that we've got that I just described to come out of this and play offense. There's just so much uncertainty business by business. We talked about some upside in consumer. I think that's valid. The others, it's just too difficult. I'll look to see if Kevin has any additional color or Mike Valentino. Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, I don't have anything to add to that. Analyst: Yes, thanks for the color and thanks for your time. Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you. President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Sinnott with Cowen. Analyst: Good morning everyone and thanks for taking my call. A couple of questions from me. First off, just generally, are your employees back to work or where are we in that process? And if that's delayed or sped up versus your estimates, how might that affect the actual new revenue guide? And then in terms of all the different segments in which you've taken down the sales outlook, is there any portion of that that's attributable, not simply to overall reduced economic activity or lower customer orders, but specifically somewhere where you're having an issue with the supply chain and you can't meet demand because of something lower down the supply chain or something like that. President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, Chris, let me this is Mike. I'll take a shot at that. With regard to our facilities, we only have one plant that we had to take down about a month ago, and that was our facility in Ameri-Kart in Southern Michigan. All of other factories have been deemed essential. They're operating from a business unit standpoint and a corporate staff standpoint, just like everyone else; we've been operating virtually out of our homes, using the Zoom tools more than we ever thought we would. But what we found is that's actually proven to be remarkably effective. You miss the human element and the human contact, but we've been able to get business done. As we talk about it here, make product, ship product, sell product, and so we're getting that done. The weakness and softness and uncertainty is just more on the customer side. So, staffed well, operating well with the exception of one plant that we're in the process of bringing back up as the demand comes back. And what was the second question, Chris? Analyst: The question was whether the revenue outlook drop is driven by the market or the supply chain. President and Chief Executive Officer: So, I'll share my thoughts there as well. It's market-driven. The supply chain, where we've had long lead-time products, we've actually proactively built that into our inventories. Our raw material inventories are in good shape. It's just more of a demand issue, but we've made some forward buys on some products that we thought may be tough to get. Analyst: Okay, that's helpful. Then just finally, I don't think the CapEx guidance of $15 million was changed. I'd have to double-check it, but I think it's the same as last time you reported. So, am I reading in too much into that in the sense that not changing CapEx like that you're really not concerned, from a liquidity standpoint? Or what the long-term effects of COVID-19 are going to be? Like all the plans you had before the end of 2019, you're still spending and executing on that? Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. So, you're correct. We did not change our CapEx outlook. It's still $15 million. Remember, first of all, on the CapEx side, about half of that is maintenance CapEx. So we want to continue to do that spending, and then the other half is growth in productivity projects. There may be some flexibility with that second half to defer some of that if it becomes necessary. But we did not include that in the outlook for the time being. Your comments about liquidity are right on the money. We have a strong balance sheet. We finished the first quarter with $73 million of cash. And we think our liquidity position really gives us the flexibility to deal with the uncertainty that this situation presents. And so we feel good about that. So, we'll continue to assess it. There may be opportunities to defer some CapEx spending. We'll assess that, but we haven't updated our outlook at this time. Analyst: That's really helpful. I appreciate everyone. Thanks. Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Chan with Baird. Analyst: Yes, thanks for taking my follow-up question, just going along with the point that Kevin just made. So, you have a very strong balance sheet. So, there shouldn't be any expectation to adjust the dividend, given the downturn in any rate, right? Just wanted to confirm that. Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Our plan is to maintain the dividend. Yes, I think we've reviewed a number of different downturn scenarios for the remainder of 2020. And I think there are a number of other measures and actions we would pursue first before we would look to change the dividend. So, our plan and preference is to maintain the dividend at current levels. Analyst: Tats great. Thank you. Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carl. Analyst: Hi, good morning. Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer: Good morning. Analyst: Just one question on the Distribution side. I know you said sales dropped off the last couple of weeks in March. Just curious maybe if you were to talk from an organic growth perspective, excluding the Tuffy acquisition, kind of how sales progressed maybe in the first couple of weeks of the month and then into April? President and Chief Executive Officer: Carl, this is Michael McGaugh. Again, just as I passed the question off to Mike Valentino on the Material Handling. I'll ask Chris DuPaul to comment on that, who's our Group President. Group President, Distribution: Yes. Thank you for the question. So, the quarter did start off a little bit soft. That softness was in line with what we're seeing in the market more broadly. We think we continue to make or gain share in the first part of the quarter, but we were just seeing overall lower volumes, lower average order sizes, and some delays in some large orders that came later in the quarter. The real shift for the segment came in the back part of March, where we saw a significant drop off, particularly in the passenger light vehicle side of the business. And that softness or that shutdown in demand has continued into Q2, which is what's driving our revenue guidance for the segment around Q2. Analyst: Great. Thanks. President and Chief Executive Officer: If I may build on that similar discussion that we've had as well. Chris' teams are focused on using the financial strength, using the strength of the company to gain share to play offense and to grow as we come out of this. Analyst: Great. Thank you. That's all I had. President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer: Thank you. We thank all of you for your interest in Myers Industries and your time and participation today. As a reminder, a transcript of this call will be available on our website within approximately 24 hours. A replay will be immediately available via webcast or call. Details can be found on the Myers Industries' website under the Investor Relations tab. Thanks and have a great day. Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.\",\n          \"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Resources Global Professionals Q4 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\\u2019s program, Kate Duchene, Chief Legal Officer. You may begin. Chief Legal Officer: Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating today. Joining me on this call are Don Murray, our Executive Chairman; Tony Cherbak, Chief Executive Officer; Tracy Stephens, Chief Operating Officer; and Nate Franke, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will be providing you with comments on our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. By now, you should have a copy of today's press release. If you need a copy and are unable to access via our website, please call Patricia Marquez at (714) 430-6314, and she'll be happy to fax a copy to you. Before introducing Tony, I'd like to read an important announcement about certain statements that we may make during this call. Specifically, we may make forward-looking statements. In other words, statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are just predictions, and actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our 10-K report for the year ended May 25, 2013, for a discussion of some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors, such as seasonal and economic conditions that may cause our business, results of operations and financial condition to differ materially from results of operations and financial conditions expressed or implied by forward-looking statements made during this call. I'll now turn the call over to Tony Cherbak, our Chief Executive Officer. Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Kate. Good afternoon. And welcome to Resources Global\\u2019s fourth quarter conference call. I am going to start by giving you a brief overview of our fourth quarter and year-end operating results. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $156.8 million, up 11.8% from our fourth quarter a year ago and 18.2% on a sequential basis. As we have previously noted, our fourth quarter was comprised of 14 weeks versus the typical 13 weeks. Excluding the 14th-week revenues, our quarter and sequential growth rates were 4.9% and 10.8%, respectively. For the year, revenue increased 2% to $567.2 million versus $556.3 million last year. Including the extra week in fiscal 2014, revenue was up about $1.1 million in comparison to 2013. During the fourth quarter, we recorded a charge of approximately $2 million or $0.05 a share to reduce personnel and certain of our European offices. Of the total, approximately $300,000 was recorded in cost services and $1.7 million in SG&A depending on whether the person impacted was an employee consultant or front office personnel. The $300,000 charge to cost of services reduced our fourth quarter gross margin by 20 basis points. Fourth quarter gross margin including the 20 basis point impact from the European severance charge was 38.9%, representing a 290 basis point improvement from the third quarter and was the same as the fourth quarter a year ago. During the fourth quarter, our SG&A costs were $46.2 million, which includes $1.7 million of the aforementioned severance costs. Excluding this cost, fourth quarter SG&A was $44.5 million or $2.2 million higher than the comparable quarter a year ago. This increase primarily results from the extra week during the fourth quarter of fiscal \\u201914. As Nate will discuss, the portion of the severance charge we anticipated to record in Q4 should be recorded over the next couple of quarters as we resolve the remaining contingencies with respect to the individuals affected. During the fourth quarter, we generated cash flow from operations and adjusted EBITDA of $18.4 million and $16.4 million, respectively. For the quarter, our pretax income was $13.5 million. Based upon an effective tax rate of 49.1%, our fourth quarter GAAP net income was $6.9 million or $0.18 a share, inclusive of the $0.05 per share impact of the severance charge. Excluding the severance charge, net income per share was $0.23. During fiscal 2014, we returned $40.2 million of capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Now on to revenue trends. As we reported in early April, weekly revenues during the first four weeks of the fourth quarter averaged $11.4 million. For the remaining non-holiday weeks of the quarter, weekly revenues ranged from $11.2 million to $11.5 million. As we have discussed the past couple of quarters, we continue to see improving demand for our services, particularly in the U.S. On a comparable 13-week basis, U.S. revenue was up 7.7% quarter-over-quarter, Asia-Pac revenue increased 2.2% quarter-over-quarter and Europe's fourth quarter revenue declined by 11.8% quarter-over-quarter. To reverse Europe's revenue contraction, we continue to provide support on several fronts from instituting programs to stimulate new cross-border revenue to providing U.S. specialist assistance in areas like supply chain and information management. After taking out a fairly significant level of costs with the personnel reductions in the fourth quarter, we are hopeful to see improvement in our European operations in the latter half of fiscal 2015. During the first six weeks of our first quarter fiscal 2015, our weekly revenues totaled $66.4 million, about 7.8% higher than the comparable period in the first quarter a year ago. Additionally, I'm pleased to announce that Tanja Cebula who previously oversaw our western region has agreed to take on a new role as our Chief Innovation Officer. In this role Tanja will work with our senior field leadership and practice area subject matter experts to bring focus to scaling new and existing business ideas to accelerate revenue growth. With that, I will now turn the call over to Nate for a detailed review of our financial results. Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Tony. As mentioned, total revenues for the quarter were $156.8 million, up 11.8% quarter-over-quarter and 18.2%, sequentially. On a constant currency basis, the quarter-over-quarter increase was 11.6% and the sequential increase was 18%. For the 2014 fiscal year, revenues were $567.2 million versus $556.3 million in fiscal 2013. Our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter and year consisted of 14 weeks and 53 weeks versus 13 weeks and 52 weeks in fiscal 2013. Revenues during the 14th-week of our fourth quarter, which included the Memorial Day holiday in the U.S., were $9.8 million, split 80% in the U.S. and 20% internationally. The following geographic revenue data utilizes Q4 fiscal 2014 revenues for 14 weeks, compared to the prior quarters comprising 13 weeks. For the fourth quarter, revenues in the U.S. were $124.3 million, up 14.8% quarter-over-quarter and 20.2%, sequentially. For the fourth quarter, total revenues internationally were $32.5 million, up 1.9% quarter-over-quarter and up 10.9%, sequentially. International revenue accounted for approximately 21% of total revenues for the quarter versus 22% in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and 23% in the prior year quarter. Europe's fourth quarter revenues decreased 6.4% quarter-over-quarter and increased 1.6% sequentially. While the Asia-Pacific region saw fourth quarter revenues increase 9.8% quarter-over-quarter and 26.3%, sequentially. On a constant currency basis, total international revenue increased 0.9% quarter-over-quarter and 9.9%, sequentially. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, the U.S. dollar was weaker against the major currencies in Europe and stronger against the Asia-Pacific currencies. As a result, on a constant currency basis, Europe's quarter-over-quarter revenue decrease was 10.3%, while Asia-Pacific quarter-over-quarter revenue would have increased 13%. As Tony detailed, on a comparable quarter-over-quarter 13-week basis, U.S. revenue was up 7.7%, Asia-Pacific's revenue increased 2.2% and Europe\\u2019s fourth quarter revenue declined 11.8%. Let me now discuss early revenue trends for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Weekly revenues for the first six weeks of the quarter, which included the 4th of July holiday, aggregated to approximately $66.4 million, which is approximately 7.8% higher than the comparable period last year. On a weekly basis, they were $11.4 million, $11.3 million, $11.6 million, $11.5 million, $9.3 million, and $11.2 million. The fifth week included the 4th of July holiday. And thinking about the remainder of the quarter, it is important to remember that we generally lose about 5% of weekly revenue due to vacations taken by consultants in the U.S. and Europe during the mid-July through August timeframe. Using 95% of the non-holiday weekly average achieved during the first five non-holiday weeks of the quarter, the weekly revenue computed for the remaining seven weeks of the first quarter would be about $10.8 million per week, which yields first quarter revenue of approximately $142 million. This computation is purely mathematical and does not consider potential increases or decreases in weekly run rates over the balance of the quarter. Labor Day will fall in our second quarter similar to fiscal 2014. Now I\\u2019ll discuss gross margins. Gross margins for the fourth quarter were 38.9%, the same as the year-ago quarter and up from 36% in the third quarter. The 290 basis point increase in sequential gross margin stems primarily from U.S. holidays during the fourth quarter, the reduced impact of FICA taxes and improvement in bill pay spreads. As Tony mentioned during the fourth quarter, we recorded a severance charge, a portion of which reduced our gross margin by approximately $300,000 or 20 basis points. Excluding reimbursable expenses, our fourth quarter gross margin was 39.5%, which compares to 39.7% in the fourth quarter a year ago. The average rounded billing rate for the quarter was approximately $125, the same as in the third quarter and down from $128 a year ago. The average rounded pay rate for the fourth quarter was approximately $63, down from $64 in the third quarter and a year ago. Please remember these hourly rates are derived based upon prevailing exchange rates during each period given. For the first quarter, we would expect gross margin to approximate the fourth quarter percentage of 38.9%. For the fourth quarter, gross margin in the U.S. was 40.1% and our international gross margin was 34.2%. Our consolidated gross margin for fiscal 2014 was 38.1% compared to 38.5% in fiscal 2013. Now, for headcount. For the fourth quarter, the average consultant FTE count was 2,309. This compares to 2,233 in the previous quarter and 2,217 in the year-ago quarter. Quarter end consultant headcount was 2,401 versus 2,208 a year ago. Total headcount of the company was 3,113 at quarter end. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter were $46.2 million or 29.5% of revenue versus $42.3 million or 30.2% of revenue a year ago. As Tony mentioned, our fourth quarter fiscal 2014 SG&A includes $1.7 million of severance charges related to European personnel. Excluding the severance charge, fourth quarter SG&A was $44.5 million, approximately $2.9 million higher than our third quarter. The increase primarily stems from the extra week in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the severance charge, we believe SG&A expenses in the first quarter will approximate $43.7 million. During the first quarter, the sequential decline in SG&A stemming from the extra week in the fourth quarter and savings from European actions are offset in part by an increase in marketing costs, including a global plan service meeting held in June, an increase in FICA taxes and other costs associated with annual incentive compensation paid in July and headcount reductions, where we are experiencing significant growth. For modeling purposes, the remaining severance charge of $800,000 could be split evenly between the first and second quarter but will ultimately be dependent on timing associated with the individuals being impacted. Stock compensation expense was $1.6 million or 1% of total revenues, the same as the third quarter and down from $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. We would anticipate quarterly stock compensation to approximate the fourth quarter amount in the upcoming quarters. At the end of the fourth quarter, our office count was 68, 45 domestic and 23 international. Related to other components of our financial statements, depreciation and amortization were $1.3 million for the quarter, about the same as last quarter. We would expect depreciation and amortization expense for the upcoming two quarters to approximate $1.3 million per quarter and decline to approximately $1 million in the third and fourth quarters. Our adjusted EBITDA or cash flow margin, which we define as EBITDA before stock compensation was 10.5% in the fourth quarter, a 470 basis point increase from 5.8% in the third quarter and a 60 basis point increase from the year-ago quarter. For fiscal 2014, our adjusted EBITDA percentage was 8.8%, down from 9.6% in fiscal 2013. During the fourth quarter, on a GAAP basis, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $6.6 million on pretax income of $13.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of approximately 49.1%. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was less than anticipated due to the lower-than-expected severance charge recorded in Europe. Excluding the severance charge for which we recorded no tax benefits, the fourth quarter effective tax rate would have been 42.9%. Our fiscal 2014 effective tax rate was 47.9% and continues to be impacted by our current inability to offset income and tax jurisdictions in which we are profitable with losses and tax jurisdictions in which we are not. Our cash tax rate continues to approximate 42%. For the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we anticipate a tax rate approximating 48%, excluding the impact of the residual European severance charges. Our GAAP tax rate for each of the upcoming quarters is difficult to predict and could be volatile as the rate will be dependent on several factors, including the mix of operating results between our U.S. and foreign locations, each of which are taxed or benefited at different statutory rates and the offset of the tax benefit of foreign losses in certain locations by valuation allowances. In summary, our GAAP per share income during the fourth quarter was $0.18, including the $0.05 impact of the previously mentioned severance charges. Excluding severance charges, per share income was $0.23. For fiscal 2014, our GAAP per share income was $0.51, slightly better than the GAAP per share income in fiscal 2013 of $0.50. Now I\\u2019ll turn to the balance sheet. Cash and investments at the end of the fourth quarter were $114.3 million, up $7 million from the third quarter. The increase results from cash generated from operations during the fourth quarter of $18.4 million, offset in part by share repurchases and dividends totaling approximately $10.7 million and capital expenditures of approximately $623,000 during the quarter. For fiscal 2015, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $2 million, of which about $500,000 should occur in the first quarter. For fiscal 2014, we generated cash flow from operations of $32 million. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 601,000 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $8 million or $13.23 per share. During fiscal 2014, we repurchased a total of 2.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $29.6 million or $13.19 per share. The shares purchased represent 5.6% of our outstanding shares as of the beginning of fiscal 2014. Our current stock buyback program has approximately $43 million remaining. We will continue to return cash to shareholders through our regular quarterly dividend and share repurchases while maintaining a balance between the capital requirements of growing our business and fiscal prudence. Our shares outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter were approximately 38.2 million. Receivables at quarter end were approximately $90.3 million compared to $89 million at the end of the third quarter. Days of revenue outstanding were approximately 56 days versus 59 days in the third quarter and 55 days in the comparable quarter a year ago. Executive Chairman: Thank you, Nate. As we\\u2019ve commented during the past couple of quarters, we continue to see improving demand for our services in the U.S. And during the fourth quarter, this was reflected in our quarter-over-quarter U.S. growth rate of 7.7% on a comparable 13-week basis. As we begin fiscal 2015, we continue to see clients commence new initiatives and expand current ones. Let me share a few examples. Recently, we commenced IT security, governance, and vendor risk assessment initiatives at a large healthcare organization. In June, we were engaged by a large financial institution to help them establish a regulatory program office to manage the regulatory compliance efforts. A global financial system transformation initiative of which we began work in the first half of fiscal 2014 has now grown to approximately 40 consultants globally. We are pleased that our focus on maintaining long-term client relationships continues to pay off. We will continue to focus efforts to improve our operating results in Europe. Our global platform is vital to us while serving our Fortune 500 client base. For example, we would not have won the previously mentioned financial system transformation engagement without our global footprint. From a cash generating standpoint, our business remains strong. As Nate detailed, the cash generated from our operations in fiscal 2014 and 2013 allowed us to return over $83.9 million to shareholders during the two-year period. Our Board of Directors will evaluate an increase to our dividend in our upcoming Board meeting. I also anticipate we will continue our trend of share repurchases in fiscal 2015. As we entered 2015, our clients provide a solid foundation for growth as economic uncertainty continues to abate, hopefully. Related to our clients, I'm pleased to report the following statistics for fiscal 2014. Client continuity remains outstanding. During our fiscal 2014, we served all of our top 50 clients from fiscal 2013 and 2012. From fiscal 2014, we served 225 clients exceeding $500,000 in fees compared to 216 served at this level in fiscal 2013. During fiscal 2014, our top 50 clients represented 38% of total revenue and while 50% of our revenues came from 89 clients. Our loyal client following reflects our client service approach and the quality of the work performed by our consultants. Our largest client for the year was approximately 1.7% of revenue. And for fiscal 2014, 96% of our top 50 clients used more than one service line, and 76% of those top 50 clients used three or more service lines. This service line penetration reflects the diversity of relationships we have within our current organizations. So this concludes our prepared remarks. We\\u2019d be happy to answer your questions at this time. Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Analyst: Thank you so much. In looking at your office count, it looks like it\\u2019s down about five offices on a year-over-year basis, a couple in the U.S. and three outside the U.S. Are you happy with your office footprint platform as it stands? Do you think we will see any more closures? And then on the flip side, as revenues continue to grow, do you think there are any areas that you might be adding offices in? Thanks. Chief Executive Officer: Yes, Jeff, we don\\u2019t have any plans to close any other offices. Generally, the offices that we closed have been when leases have come up and we have been able to consolidate the operations with an office nearby. I would say, when we have a client need that usually dictates the opening of a new office, but right now, we don't see any real change in that game plan for the time being. Analyst: Okay. And then I don\\u2019t know if I read this information beforehand, but somebody in other companies in your space gives us some guidance in terms of incremental margins when you get incremental revenues. Is there a goal that the company has in mind? Chief Executive Officer: Well, Jeff, the long-term goal of the company is to continue to work to try to achieve a 15% EBITDA margin. Our view, obviously, is that that has not changed as a goal. Obviously, the timeline to get there from where we were five or six years ago has elongated, but we continue to work towards that goal. There are investments that we will make along the way. We're seeing certain practice offices really start to grow at a nice pace. So we\\u2019re starting to add people to those, but we don\\u2019t necessarily have a definitive quarter-to-quarter margin. We tend to be opportunistic when we find that people have client situations in a particular area. Analyst: All right. Are there any areas that are doing better than others, or are you just seeing weakness all across the board? Chief Executive Officer: No, there are a couple of offices that are doing well, like our U.K. office, which we used to have a lot of problems with. That seems to have straightened itself out. We've added some new people, and that has helped. And surprisingly enough, our little Italian office, which is probably operating in the worst economy in all of Europe, is doing quite well. They grew over 60% last year. So, those two offices are doing well. We've got a lot of work to do in front of us for Europe, but we plan to -- we're trying to help them by bringing some of our specialist capabilities to Europe like in IM and supply chain that I talked about a little bit earlier. And we\\u2019re looking at a couple of key hires on the business development front. So we're hoping that in the latter part of 2015 we will start to see some improvement. Analyst: All right. That\\u2019s great to hear. And then just a quick numbers question, did you give revenues for Europe and Asia Pac? Chief Financial Officer: I think we gave revenue increases. Let me get those for you. For the 14 weeks, the revenues in Europe were $19 million. In Asia Pac, it was $10.1 million. Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Macquarie. Your line is open. Analyst: Great. Thanks. So it looks like from a gross margin perspective, sequentially, you\\u2019re going to be flat which if I have already, typically steps down. Is there anything -- is it kind of better pricing or better healthcare costs that are driving kind of that flat sequential trend there? Am I just not thinking about that right? Chief Executive Officer: Well, you\\u2019re thinking about it right, but I would tell you there are really two components. One, if you look to Q1 that we are currently in versus last year, we do have one less holiday and that is because Memorial Day fell into the quarter. But the other half of the forecast and improvement is the improvement in bill pay spreads. Analyst: Indeed. Is that just a better kind of because it sounds like the rates were down year-on-year, is that right? Chief Executive Officer: But there was an improvement and that\\u2019s about half of going from Q1 a year ago to Q1 \\u201915. Analyst: Got it. And then just kind of a more high-level question, I mean if I look in the \\u201916 and I am not looking for a specific guidance, but assuming kind of a $600 million run rate business, we take that close to $800 million back in \\u201907. As you think about kind of that delta, what\\u2019s really driven the lack of kind of meaningful revenue uptick to this cycle? Is it more client-centric or the type of work you\\u2019re doing or just what\\u2019s driving kind of the lackluster revenue growth over the course of the sub-cycle? Chief Executive Officer: So if you look at, what I would tell you if you look at the Fortune 500, as you look back over the last couple of years, they all remain our clients, but they have all been operating in what I would call a very constrained SG&A, where they have deferred projects, they have been reluctant to spend as they fight with their own top line issues. As I think we commented over the last couple of quarters; we are seeing that starting to change, and that\\u2019s why I think, especially in the U.S., you are starting to see that growth curve pick up. In many cases, these companies, some of the initiatives they can\\u2019t defer forever, that\\u2019s especially true in the regulatory environment, but we are seeing that in other initiatives too encompassing some other things. Don had commented just around risk management and those types of things. Analyst: Are you seeing anything in terms of meaningful way after the Volcker Rule, I know we talked about that in the past? Chief Executive Officer: I would tell you in our financial services vertical kind of the Volcker Rule or all of the Dodd, the various elements of Dodd-Frank, which we kind of labeled as this whole regulatory compliance area. We are seeing good demand in that area. Chief Financial Officer: And there\\u2019s really -- and Kevin, there\\u2019s really more than just the Dodd-Frank rule as this all regulatory compliance has been a real boom for us. So we expect great things in 2015 from that business. Analyst: Got it. And then -- I\\u2019m good for now. Okay. Thank you. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Analyst: Good afternoon. I apologize. I missed a portion of the initial comments. So I can come back offline on these, but would you mind repeating just what the constant currency growth rates were in the various geographies outside of the U.S.? Chief Financial Officer: Sure. So on a constant currency basis, the international revenue increased nine-tenths of the percent quarter-over-quarter and 9.9% sequentially. Then on a quarter-over-quarter basis, Europe was down 10.3% and Asia Pac was up 13%. Analyst: And that Europe being down 10.3%, is that adjusted for the -- is that a \\u201813 versus \\u201813 or is that the \\u201814? Chief Executive Officer: Those are \\u201814 versus \\u201813 GAAP, not the constant currency\\u2019s GAAP, but it\\u2019s computed on a GAAP basis. On a 13-week basis, Europe was down 15.8 and Asia Pac would have been up 5.4%. Analyst: Up 5.4%. Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Analyst: Okay. Thank you. And with regards to, so when we think about the European ops, you\\u2019ve taken some actions over there. What sort of savings should we end up getting from those actions and when we think about the annualized savings? Chief Executive Officer: We put this in our formal comments. I think in the third quarter, we said that the overall savings will be approximately $4 million. Now there will be some reinvestment there. So it won't be the entire $4 million, but we will have to reinvest some of that into the operations for certain key positions, but it will be the bulk of it. Analyst: Okay. Great. And then with regards to the -- just staying on Europe and you made the comment with regards to the U.K. and Italy. Are the other areas, even though they're not showing growth, are they showing signs of stabilization? Chief Executive Officer: We would -- I think to some of Europe, we've done the easy work now, which is it's not easy actually doing it, but it\\u2019s easier than what we have to do. What we have to do now is grow the practice. And our Chief Operating Officer has been, as I said before, working significantly in this area. We\\u2019ve done a great evaluation of all of the talent over there. We know the places that we have to fill in with additional talent and that\\u2019s where we\\u2019re just trying to work on. So it depends, Mark, area by area, but right now we\\u2019re in the mode of trying to grow those practices and to help them where we can from the U.S. operations where we can give them advice and loan them some of our expertise in the various different areas like IT and supply chain. Analyst: Okay. Great. And then with regards to the U.S., it was nice to see the commentary with regards to the broadening of the revenue trends. Can you talk a little bit about whether that's coming from a few key clients across the country or are you seeing just a much healthier attitude among all of your clients? Chief Executive Officer: I would just tell you just relative to industries, we\\u2019re doing really good in healthcare, technology, financials, pharma, and energy. It\\u2019s across all of those areas. So it\\u2019s pretty broad. And just to give you an idea of the magnitude of the U.S. operations, we had 26 clients in Q4 that generated fees of over $1 million. So it's pretty broad-based, it\\u2019s very broad industry-based, and we\\u2019re just very pleased to see the traction across many different initiatives. Analyst: That\\u2019s great. And can you talk about the practices. I know we operate as one firm, but when we think about finance and accounting versus RAS versus IM, can we talk a little bit about how \\u2026. Chief Executive Officer: You\\u2019re talking about our service lines, right? Every service line in 2014 grew with the exception of accounting and finance. And it was only down by 1%, but since it\\u2019s such a big piece of our business. You can see where the increases in the other service lines kind of offset the decrease in finance and accounting so that we didn't have too much growth in 2014. But we're certainly expecting to reverse that trend in 2015. Analyst: Can you give us a breakout in terms of the percentage of revenue that\\u2019s coming from those service lines at this point, roughly? Chief Executive Officer: Well, as we\\u2019ve talked about in the past, finance and accounting is roughly 50% of our business. Information management is about 20%, supply chain, and the balance of the service lines range from 4% to 8%. Except legal -- legals are a little bit smaller, but legal grew significantly in 2014. Analyst: How much did that grow? Chief Executive Officer: 40%. Analyst: And what\\u2019s that up to now? Chief Executive Officer: We don\\u2019t give out the absolute dollars of the individual practices. Analyst: Okay, but that is -- so basically, I mean, 50% of your business is growing quite nicely at this point. Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Analyst: And F&A is basically stabilizing? Chief Executive Officer: It\\u2019s stabilizing, but we anticipate one big event that occurred on the regulatory front, being the finalization of the revenue recognition standard could give that a big boost in 2015 and beyond. We've seen a lot -- we\\u2019ve seen preliminary interest from a lot of companies wanting to talk to us about how the revenue recognition standards impact their business. Analyst: Which specific provision are you referring to there? Chief Executive Officer: Well, there is -- basically we\\u2019ve been waiting for a new revenue recognition standard. This prior kind of been in the works for several years and it got finalized in Q4, I believe. So it affects all companies starting in 2017, but the provisions are such that companies might need to retrospectively restate their results so that they have comparability with the new standards. So you know when a public company has a five-year table of disclosure in its 10-K. So we believe that a lot of these big public companies are starting now to look at it and we\\u2019re ready to help them. Analyst: Great. And then with regards to the U.S. in terms of that nice growth that you're seeing. Would you say that your competitors are also seeing that growth or do you think there's any market share gains that you might be giving? Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. Mark, I guess it\\u2019s hard to say. I mean, I think we\\u2019re clearly seeing in each of our clients, the demand environment improving. Maybe we could talk in a couple of weeks as some of our competitors announce their June 30 quarter. We continue to win work. We\\u2019ve just in the past three or four weeks, we won several engagements from model. We competed against the Big Four. But again, it\\u2019s always hard to judge on a broad basis. Analyst: Great. And then just going to the gross margin, was there any positive impact just in terms of some of the healthcare costs being spread out a little bit in terms of 14 weeks? If I go back to some of the prior years where we\\u2019ve had 14-week quarters, we've had some gross margin benefit from that. Is that -- did that impact at all? Chief Executive Officer: Not in the case of healthcare and kind of payroll. Those are almost paid on either biweekly or weekly basis. Analyst: Okay. Great. So it sounds like \\u2026. Chief Executive Officer: In terms of \\u201814 -- in terms of what you\\u2019re saying that 14 week leverage, that did come from healthcare? Analyst: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Don for closing remarks. Executive Chairman: We\\u2019d like to thank you very much our investors and our analysts for their interest in Resources. And we look forward to talking to you with our first quarter results. Thanks. Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This now concludes the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.\",\n          \"VP, Investor Relations: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Arrowhead's results for its fiscal 2016 second quarter ended March 31st, 2016. With us today from management are President and CEO, Dr. Chris Anzalone, who will provide an overview of the quarter; Dr. Bruce Given, our Chief Operating Officer and Head of R&D, who will discuss our clinical programs; and Ken Myszkowski, our Chief Financial Officer, who will give a review of the financials. We will then open up the call to your questions. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made during today's call may contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, including, without limitation, those with respect to Arrowhead's goals, plans, and strategies, are forward-looking statements. These include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the anticipated safety and/or efficacy of ARC-520, ARC-521, ARC-AAT, ARC-F12, ARC-LTA, ARC-HIF2, and our other programs, as well as anticipated timing for study enrollment and completion, and the potential for regulatory and commercial success. They represent management's current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Thus, actual results may differ materially. Arrowhead undertakes no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements discussed on today's call. You should refer to the discussions under risk factors in Arrowhead's annual report on Form 10-K and the company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for additional matters to be considered in this regard. With that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Dr. Christopher Anzalone, President and CEO of the company. Chris? President and CEO: Thanks, Vince. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. This is our first earnings call as Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, and I wanted to take a moment to talk about our name change. While we remain a company rooted in research and world-class science, our top priority is advancing products through clinical development to bring innovative new medicines to patients. The name Arrowhead Research was simply no longer an accurate representation of the Company. Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals reflects the progress we're making on our growing pipeline of RNAi-based therapeutics. We have quickly become a company with multiple clinical stage products, and we plan on having additional products enter clinical trials over the next year and beyond. This is an 'and' move rather than an 'or'. While we expand our focus to include clinical and eventually commercial development, we remain fiercely innovative and continue to drive big science. Our proprietary and constantly evolving technologies give us a robust and versatile drug discovery and development platform. This allows us to continually build on successes from each program and develop effective new therapies rapidly, cost-effectively, and potentially with lower risk relative to traditional approaches. This is reflected in the speed at which we've gone from one clinical candidate to our current pipeline of six programs targeting a broad range of disease areas. It is also reflected in the confidence we have in ARC-AAT and ARC-521, for instance. We now know that ARC-520 does exactly what it was designed to do: it consistently and deeply reduces expression of HBV cccDNA. We also know that it does this in a well-tolerated manner. ARC-520 has been given to over 150 people, and we continue to see a favorable safety profile. This high activity and emerging safety profile should read on ARC-AAT and ARC-521 because both use the exact same DPC delivery technology as ARC-520. It is uncommon in the pharmaceutical industry to have this carry-over safety and activity understanding as new drugs come to the clinic, and this is a substantial value driver. We've made a great deal of progress across all of our programs as well as the underlying platforms during the FY16 second quarter and the period since our last conference call. I'll discuss a few of them now and provide some context. Later in the call, Bruce Given will give some more detail and provide a status update on our clinical studies. I mentioned ARC-520, and let's talk a bit about that. During the quarter we continued to execute quite well, and there are now seven ARC-520 clinical studies actively enrolling patients. As a reminder, the following is a list of current studies: 1002 is a single dose study in healthy volunteers testing faster infusion rates of ARC-520. 2002 is a placebo controlled, three-month study of ARC-520 plus NUCs in NUC-experienced e-negative patients. 2003 is the same as 2002, but in e-positive NUC-experienced patients. 2007 is an open label nine-month extension for patients in 2002 and 2003 who achieve a 0.5 log or greater reduction in circulating s-antigen, providing a full year of therapy for eligible patients. 2004 is our US-only placebo-controlled three-month study of ARC-520 plus NUCs in e-positive patients. 2001 extension is an open label study of one year of ARC-520 treatment on top of NUCs in patients from the single-dose 2001 study; 54 of the 58 patients from 2001 are eligible to participate. MONARCH is our open label study that includes arms with ARC-520 alone and triple therapy with ARC-520 plus NUCs plus interferon. We intend to open additional arms as combinations with new compounds become available. These are a lot of studies, and we will enroll a large number of patients. Given the diversity of disease factors, they will be required to gain a more complete understanding of ARC-520 and how it works. These studies will span various HBV genotypes, NUC experience, and e-antigen status. We go into these studies as clear intellectual leaders in HBV. Between our long-term study in chronically infectedchimps and our ARC-520 studies to date, we have moved the HBV field forward, and I expect to retain this leadership position this year and beyond. We clearly have a comprehensive clinical program. The data continue to indicate that ARC-520 is highly active against cccDNA-derived mRNA transcripts and thus can reduce the production of HBV proteins. Keep in mind, the virus hijacks patients' hepatocytes to make only five proteins and pre-genomic RNA. That is all this virus does, and our data suggest that we silence every one of them. Several, and possibly all, of these proteins are believed to contribute to immune suppression and, therefore, chronicity of HBV infection as the body is unable to control the virus. Many believe that dramatically reducing both circulating and intrahepatic proteins will make it increasingly difficult for the virus to continue to evade immune control. In theory, this mode of action should be a powerful tool against the virus. It is difficult to imagine that the virus could continue its normal lifecycle while everything it is capable of making is silenced. Of course, we are testing that theory now. In addition to what ARC-520 can do on its own, it could be a powerful backbone therapy that is complementary to other therapeutic mechanisms, and we are eager to interrogate this possibility with various agents in our MONARCH study. We continue to see ARC-520 as a key to enabling functional cures in patients with chronic HBV infection. As we have said previously, ARC-520 appears to be maximally active in patients with higher relative levels of HBV cccDNA versus HBV that has integrated into the host DNA. During the quarter, we presented additional data at the EASL International Liver Congress in e-antigen positive treatment naive patients from cohort 7 of the 2001 study. This patient group is predicted to have higher relative levels of cccDNA. These data show how powerful ARC-520 is against cccDNA-derived transcripts and how deeply we can knockdown HBV proteins. We saw a max knockdown of s-antigen of almost 2 logs, or 99%, and a dramatic duration of effect. We had previously reported the former, but the latter represented new data. In this group of patients s-antigen was still reduced by 83% two months after a single dose and 75% after three months, which is the final time point of the study. In fact, one of the six patients demonstrated approximately 1 log, or 90% reduction, of circulating s-antigen 85 days after a single dose of ARC-520. These are important data because there has simply never been a reliable report that approaches this depth and duration, particularly after a single dose of a therapeutic. In addition, serum HBV DNA reductions of up to 5.5 logs were observed. These were exciting data for us and for the HBV community, and give us great confidence in our ongoing multiple dose and combination studies. In addition to ARC-520, we also recently announced that we filed for regulatory clearance to begin a Phase 1/2 study of ARC-521, our second pipeline candidate targeting chronic HBV. We think having both ARC-520, which has been very active in patients with higher cccDNA, and ARC-521, which may be optimal for those with lower cccDNA, should provide us with greater potential to treat all HBV patients. We have an aggressive plan for the development of ARC-521 that includes an accelerated first-in-man Phase 1/2 design intended to allow rapid transition into multi-dose patient cohorts. Our plan was to file regulatory submissions toward the end of this quarter, so we are already a couple of months ahead of schedule. We will provide more details about the design when we initiate the study, so stay tuned. We have moved very fast with this program, and we think ARC-521 increases our leadership position in the HBV space and the race to a functional cure. Turning to ARC-AAT, we continue to accrue our Phase 1 single-ascending dose study that consists of Part A in healthy volunteers and Part B in patients with AAT deficiency. We remain on schedule to complete enrollment and release top line results from both the expanded Part A and Part B this year and report full data at relevant medical meetings. We are currently preparing a pilot Phase 2a multiple-dose study of ARC-AAT that we intend to begin this year. During the quarter we also presented new data on our three disclosed preclinical programs: ARC-F12, ARC-HIF2, and ARC-LPA. These programs represent not only our expanding pipeline of RNAi therapeutics against a wide range of diseases but also progress we are making on our underlying technology platforms. I will quickly go over these one by one. First, ARC-F12 is designed to inhibit the production of Factor 12. In an edema model in rats, ARC-F12 led to a significant reduction in swelling. In animal models of thrombosis, ARC-F12 reduced the risk of blood clot formation without the undesirable bleeding risk caused by anticoagulants. These support our belief that ARC-F12 has the potential to treat both hereditary angioedema, or HAE, and to prevent thrombosis. These are very different patient populations, and we have both subcutaneous and intravenous formats for this program, so we are currently assessing what the best clinical path will be for this product. We plan on discussing this more in the future. ARC-HIF2 is the first candidate to use a DPC vehicle designed for extra-hepatic delivery. ARC-HIF2 targets HIF-2alpha for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. We presented preclinical data showing proof of concept for the delivery vehicle, and that ARC-HIF2 could inhibit tumor growth and promote tumor cell death in multiple RCC mouse models. This represents both an exciting new candidate and an expansion of our DPC platform. Lastly, ARC-LPA is the first RNAi therapeutic to use Arrowhead's new delivery vehicles designed for subcutaneous administration. This preclinical candidate is targeting lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. High levels of Lp(a) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease independent of cholesterol and LDL, and there is currently no good way to deeply reduce circulating levels of Lp(a). Data we recently presented show that ARC-LPA can achieve up to a 98% reduction of Lp(a) in mice, and 85% to 90% in primates with significant reductions through at least six weeks. We think this is a very attractive candidate on its own, and we are excited about our new subcutaneous platform that may create additional opportunities to address diseases that require chronic treatment and where the subcutaneous route may be preferable to patients and physicians. So as you've heard, this has been another highly productive quarter for us at Arrowhead. We're confident that novel medicines like the ones we're developing at Arrowhead that treat intractable diseases will, in the end, always have great value. We are committed to pushing our pipeline forward and unlocking that value. With that overview, I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Bruce Given, our COO and head of R&D. Bruce? COO and Head of R&D: Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I go over the status of our various clinical studies, I want to discuss the ARC-520 data presented at the International Liver conference last month. We shared a poster detailing the final cohort 7 results from the 2001 study and a poster with new findings from our innovative chimpanzee study. Additionally, our colleagues from the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Melbourne shared some of their advanced analytical work from the first five cohorts of the 2001 study. Let me highlight some of the more interesting findings. All three posters are available on our website.  First, regarding our Hep-ARC 2001 cohort 7 poster, ARC-520 and entecavir quickly suppressed HBV DNA in hepatitis e-antigen-positive, treatment-naive patients, achieving significant reductions in serum HBV DNA after just two weeks and overall reductions of up to 5.5 logs. All e-antigen-negative, treatment-naive patients experienced reductions that brought them below the detection limit, with nearly all achieving this by week two. We previously reported that ARC-520 showed moderate to strong synergism with entecavir and tenofovir in mice, and we believe this data aligns with those findings. We think this synergism occurs because ARC-520 likely reduces levels of polymerase and pre-genomic RNA, suggesting that similar benefits could arise from other mechanisms and agents that also reduce viral antigens or pre-genomic RNA. Capsid inhibitors and drugs targeting X antigen would be strong candidates for such benefits.  The full three-month data also indicated that ARC-520 effectively inhibited HBV CccDNA-derived mRNA, showing viral protein reductions in naive e-antigen-positive patients of up to 99% after a single dose. As Chris mentioned earlier, the duration of s-antigen reduction in e-antigen-positive, treatment-naive patients is noteworthy. The mean reduction at the last study visit on day 85 was still 75% from baseline following a single dose of ARC-520. We observed an intriguing flattening of the rebound curve between days 57 and 85. Mean e-antigen and core-related antigen levels, when measurable, were also reduced at day 85. As mentioned previously, naive e-negative patients exhibited a delayed mean s-antigen response that didn't appear until about three weeks post-dose. Although the overall mean reduction was less in e-negative patients, it still hadn\\u2019t returned to baseline by day 85. The academic community continues to recognize the significance of these findings, and the poster was highlighted during the HBV expert tour and featured in a general lecture on HBV. We have also been invited to present our data at a recent NIH workshop focused on HBV.  In our chimpanzee study poster, we demonstrated that following six to eleven monthly doses of ARC-520 in chimpanzees chronically infected with HBV, the target site sequences of ARC-520 remained mostly unchanged, indicating no drug resistance developed during the treatment period. While we did not anticipate mutation and resistance being issues, this reinforces our confidence as we proceed with our multi-dose studies in HBV patients. We also provided additional biopsy data with deep sequencing of HBV mRNAs after treatment with ARC-520, showing that all sequences containing ARC-520 target sites were significantly reduced in both e-positive and e-negative chimps. This reaffirms our belief that while surface antigen knockdown can be influenced by the level of integrated-derived surface antigen transcript, other cccDNA-derived transcripts should be similarly reduced in either e-negative or e-positive patients. As more interest grows in the pathologic roles of all hepatitis antigens, the unique capability of RNAi and particularly ARC-520 to reduce all HBV viral transcripts becomes increasingly important. Finally, from EASL, Dr. Stephen Locarnini studied patients who have cleared surface antigen. Although rare, sero-clearance happens in a small minority of NUC-treated patients. Dr. Locarnini has used a group of monoclonal antibodies that bind specific sections of the surface antigen to identify changes in binding patterns as a method to study the host immune response. He has previously reported a clearance profile in patients who sero-cleared on tenofovir based on these binding changes. In the EASL poster from his team, he shared data from four e-negative, NUC-experienced cohorts and the first e-positive cohort from our 2001 study. He noted that by week three, around 50% of the ARC-520 treated patients exhibited a clearance profile compared to none in the placebo group. There was also a related trend in the detection of immune complexes. While the significance of these findings regarding ARC-520's ability to achieve sero-clearance is still unclear, they continue to captivate the academic HBV community.  Now, I will briefly update you on some of our clinical studies. The 1002 study is a single dose study assessing the tolerability of increasing infusion rates of ARC-520. We have administered 5 mg/kg and will be moving to 6 mg/kg at about twice the current infusion rate. The treatment remains well-tolerated, leading us to add 5 and 6 mg/kg single-dose cohorts to the 2001 study for additional dosing flexibility if needed. As part of the 2001 study, these cohorts will involve HBV patients. In the 2001 open-label extension, most patients from the main study are eligible to participate should they choose to do so. Those who opt in will receive up to 13 doses at four-week intervals. This study has begun, and some patients from cohort 7 have already started their dosing.  Studies 2002 and 2003 are multiple dose studies in e-antigen negative and positive patients, respectively, actively recruiting participants already on entecavir or tenofovir. The 2002 study is roughly two-thirds enrolled, while the 2003 study is about halfway. We are on track to finish enrollment for both studies this year, and patients from 2002 and 2003 who achieve more than a 0.5 log reduction in s-antigen will be eligible to transition into study 2007, a long-term extension allowing dosing for up to a year. The 2007 study has commenced in Hong Kong and South Korea, with patients having begun dosing. For the MONARCH study, which primarily involves a triple combination of ARC-520, entecavir, and interferon, we started dosing in January. We have enrolled patients in three different cohorts, but we have not yet completed any of these cohorts. Initial plans for the triple combination cohorts involve administering ARC-520 every four weeks for 48 weeks, daily entecavir for 60 weeks, and pegylated interferon for 48 weeks. We aim to explore other combinations as new therapies become available. After learning about the importance of integrated DNA from our chimp study, we expedited the development of ARC-521, which combines our best RNAi trigger from ARC-520 with a trigger targeting integrated transcripts. We believe it can effectively address all HBV-derived RNA transcripts. We set a goal to submit an application for a Phase 1 study by mid-year and successfully submitted it in April. Based on what we\\u2019ve learned from ARC-520, we believe we have a good grasp of the expected doses and safety profile of ARC-521. We proposed a trial design that quickly advances into multiple doses in healthy volunteers and HBV patients. If this design is approved by IRBs and regulators, we expect to have substantial updates from this program in the upcoming quarters. Regarding ARC-AAT, we have enrolled over 50 subjects in both Part A with healthy volunteers and Part B with patients in the single-dose Phase 1 study. Our goal is to fully enroll both parts of the study by year-end. We are also preparing to initiate a pilot Phase 2a multiple-dose study to evaluate the effect on circulating AAT levels after multiple doses of ARC-AAT. Importantly, we will also take biopsies to assess the effect at the hepatocyte level. We have consulted with regulatory authorities and aim to commence this study later this year, so please stay tuned. Lastly, with the change of our corporate name, we have launched a new website at arrowheadpharma.com. The pipeline section of this site features details about our active clinical trials and links to their respective entries on clinicaltrials.gov. For more information about the studies I mentioned, please refer to that website. Now, I will hand the call over to Ken Myszkowski, Arrowhead's Chief Financial Officer. Ken? CFO: Thank you, Bruce, and good afternoon, everyone. As we reported today, our net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2016, was $20.8 million, or $0.35 per share, based on 59.8 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares with a net loss of $28.7 million, or $0.51 per share, based on 55.7 million weighted average shares outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2016 were $21.3 million, compared to $29.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The decrease in operating expenses compared to the year-ago period are primarily due to a prior-year non-cash charge of $10.1 million for acquired and processed research and development costs, a component of the accounting related to the Novartis acquisition. This was somewhat offset by higher general and administrative expenses of $2.1 million during the current period, primarily due to increased legal and patent costs. R&D costs declined by $1.6 million due to lower drug manufacturing costs but higher clinical trial costs, as our ARC-520 manufacturing campaign was completed last year and this year we are incurring higher clinical trial costs related to the ARC-520 Phase 2b studies. Net cash used in operating activities during the second fiscal quarter was $14.7 million, compared to $16.4 million in the prior-year period, a decrease of $1.6 million. This was driven by lower R&D costs and the receipt of a refundable R&D tax credit from Australia, somewhat offset by higher general and administrative expenditures. Turning to our balance sheet, at March 31, 2016, including our investments in fixed income securities, our cash and investments balance was $61.5 million, a decrease of $15.1 million from December 31, 2015. Our common shares outstanding at March 31, 2016 were 60 million, which increased from 59.6 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to the issuance of shares from restricted stock vesting and the exercise of stock options. Also, at March 31, 2016, there were 15,652 shares of preferred stock outstanding. These preferred shares are convertible into 2.7 million shares of common stock. Common shares outstanding including the conversion of our preferred shares would be 62.6 million. With that brief overview, I'll now turn the call back to Chris. President and CEO: Thanks, Ken. As you've heard, our data continue to be good and we are hitting the operational goals in our clinical programs. As I mentioned earlier, we have two candidates in the clinic, one that's about to enter the clinic, three more not too far behind, and some additional undisclosed programs that we are working on. This is a robust pipeline for a company of our size, which gives us a lot of opportunity to build value. It also is about the limit of what we can handle with our current resources, headcount, and facilities. Because of this, we are for the first time in a position where we can support and are actively looking for potential partners and collaborators to expand the reach of the assets and potentially be a source of capital. This type of strategic shift could take some time, but we think that our broad intellectual property, advanced technologies, and expertise from working in the field for more than a decade make us an extremely attractive partner. Looking ahead over the next 12 months and beyond, there are multiple events that could drive value for our shareholders. The ARC-520 MONARCH study and the 2001 extension are open-label studies that may provide opportunities to share data ahead of study completion. In addition, the clinical plan for ARC-521 is aggressive, but we feel responsible given our knowledge base. If IRBs and regulators agree, we may provide a read-out faster than some think. The ARC-AAT Phase 2a is anticipated to begin later in the year, and Phase 1 is planned to complete enrollment with a read-out this year. Behind these programs are ARC-F12, ARC-HIF2, and ARC-LPA, which are all progressing nicely and should provide additional opportunities to give updates on the candidates and their respective technology platforms. I would now like to open the call up to your questions. Operator? Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Analyst at RBC Capital Markets: Good afternoon, congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking the question. This is Judy Liu on for Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets. Two questions if I may, please. First, since you addressed that you are actively talking with potential partners, just wondering if we could get a little more clarity there. What types of discussions have you had? If you're willing to disclose what are the gating factors involved in this discussion, could you perhaps provide illustration of potential scenarios and for options? And I know you said it might take some time, but do you have any sense of broad timing? Thank you. President and CEO: Thanks very much, Judy. You know, what, there is not much we can say on that. The reason that we bring it up is that, as you point out and as we said in the prepared remarks, this is something that we are now a bit more focused on than we have in the past because we have built up this infrastructure, we built up these capabilities that enable us to do this. And our pipeline, at least for the time being, feels pretty complete. And so we've got the ability to do this, and I think we are an attractive partner because we can move quickly, because we've got, I think, pretty attractive intellectual property, because we've got good data with ARC-521. We just remarked on the data in ARC-AAT and ARC-521 for all these reasons I think that it makes sense for us to start reaching out to potential partners. Now, having said all that, we don't control the timing of any of the supports, so we'll just have to see how it plays out, but it is certainly our hope and intention to enter into some of these agreements going forward. Analyst at RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you. And my follow-up question is, you told us that 2002 is about two thirds enrolled and 2003 seems to be on track for that enrollment as well. We heard previously that you expect some open label data by maybe later this year. Is there some more specific timing you could give us, especially on the other studies, like 2002 and 2003 where enrollment is progressing, when should we be expecting readouts from that \\u2014 norm 2017, is that a good guess? COO and Head of R&D: Hi, Judy. It\\u2019s Bruce Given. It\\u2019s always a little hard to estimate. I mean, the gating items here is you have to enroll your last patient, your last patient then has to get their four doses and then have their follow-up after the fourth dose, and then you have to clean all the data and lock it because both 2002 and 2003 are double-blinded studies. So, everything has to be perfect in the database before you can finally lock it, load in the codes, and analyze the data. So, it's a little hard to get precise. I think we've been guiding that we thought it was likely to be 2017 readouts for 2002 and 2003 and that still feels like the most likely scenario. I certainly wouldn't expect it to go beyond 2017. It's really just a matter of when \\u2014 how early in 2017 might those appear, and I just can't give you perfect guidance on that at this point. President and CEO: And as you mentioned, the 2001 extension and MONARCH are open label, so of course we've got much more flexibility on how and when we could disclose some data there. That's really on a kind of wait-and-see basis. People asked us, you know, what will be the trigger point for talking about those data, and unfortunately, we don't have those criteria set in stone. It's something that we address as we see those data. So I would just say stay tuned on those open label studies. Analyst at RBC Capital Markets: Thank you. Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Aan Yang with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Analyst at Jefferies: Thank you. The study 1002 varying infusion rates, I think you guys mentioned that about two times faster than the current infusion rates, so what's the current infusion rate? President and CEO: So the current infusion rate is 0.4 mL/minute, which depending on the dose, if you're at the 4 mg/kg dose most people their infusion rates will be somewhere around 20 some minutes. So, we were curious as to whether faster rates are possible. So for instance, in this 5- and the 6-mg/kg dose group we're using an infusion rate of 0.9. So a little bit faster than two times. And that's the infusion rate that we're planning to use in the 521 study, for instance. So it looks like we could probably have shorter infusion times than we've been using, that\\u2019s at least our current interpretation of the data. And it felt like something that we should go back and visit - but the 1002 study is in normal volunteers\\u2026 Analyst at Jefferies: Yes\\u2026 President and CEO: Just to be clear about that. Analyst at Jefferies: Okay. And then, in the past you mentioned that you would anticipate announcing a clinical collaboration for ARC-520 this year, can you give us kind of a status update? President and CEO: Sure, we're still hopeful that we can bring in collaborators to MONARCH. I'll tell you, our gating function here is the lack of a huge number of these potential compounds to combine with ARC-520. We see an awful lot of interest currently in the space, the vast majority of that interest is early stage, preclinical, early clinical programs. And so it takes a little while to move those things to the clinic. So, certainly in 2017 and beyond there will be more to choose from. But, we still think that 2016 we will bring in at least one additional compound into a MONARCH cohort in addition to, of course, what we're doing with interferon. Analyst at Jefferies: Okay. And then in the past you also mentioned, I mean, there are a lot of studies, so one study you mentioned was 2006. Is that still in the plan and if so what's 2006 about? President and CEO: Yes, so 2006 was a study that we were thinking about that was looking at very detailed immunologic measures, such as T cell markers and T cell function and things of that sort. In the end that was one of the things that we decided to not do this year. Largely as a way to just sort of control our capital usage during the year. We still plan on doing a study like that, but we did set that aside for this year. COO and Head of R&D: I think the fact that we have all these studies going is really an important marker. It means a few things, at least a few things. One, it means that we are serious about this disease. We are going at this with guns blazing trying to find this functional cure, but it also means that we're going about this I think in a very mature way. This is a very difficult virus, as you know. There are a number of variables. It's not just e-antigen status, it's not just NUC experience, it's also the phenotypes, and we think the only way to really get a handle on how a drug works with this virus is to do this large number of studies. It\\u2019s too bad because it's going to require a lot of people, but it's important to understand how this thing works. And again, I think it's a reflection of our understanding of the virus and the maturation of this company as a real clinical organization. Analyst at Jefferies: Okay. Thank you. COO and Head of R&D: You're welcome. Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Adler with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Analyst at Piper Jaffray: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to maybe change gears a little bit and talk about ARC-F12. I really like the approach of ARC-HIF2 renal cell, but as you know it's an area which is evolving very rapidly and I want to get your thoughts on where the drug fits in when the dust starts settling. You have more advances in antiangiogenic, you have immuno-oncology coming in. Do you see this ultimately going in a combo do you see this still as a monotherapy? So I just sort of wanted to see how things are shaping up from your end? President and CEO: Yes, that\\u2019s really a great question. You know, renal cell carcinoma has been a bit of an outlier in cancer in that it's been receiving monotherapy mostly because the drugs that have been available really didn't play well with each other, and when people tried to do combination therapy there were toxicity limitations. We've always thought that the best approach for HIF2 and the best approach in renal cell carcinoma would be to find new agents that could play well with others, and that would allow combination therapy. So, we've always envisioned that we would hope that we would find the ability to treat in combination, and the neat thing of course about RNAi is that we administer it and then it has a durability of a month or more with a single injection, for instance. So, we're very hopeful that we will fit well into combination therapy which generally in cancer that's how you really make the big strides when you are able to go combination. So, we like the fact that there is a diversity of different drugs being developed in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and we are very hopeful that we will play well with others. COO and Head of R&D: And also I think the way to look at that is twofold. One, as a candidate we're excited about that as candidates and we think that we'll be treating this disease in a unique and powerful way. But the other way to look at this is as a platform. We view this ability to deliver to certain tumor cells as a franchise unto itself. Once we can validate that with ARC-HIF2 or anything else, or others for that matter, we can use that for other targets, for other cancer types. And so we view that as really scalable and a program with real legs. So, we're extremely excited about pushing that into the clinic at some point and really blowing that out into a business unto itself. Analyst at Piper Jaffray: I see that. So maybe just a quick follow-up, and this is more long-range thinking. So once you establish that you can target different extra-hepatic tissues and in this case tumors, a lot of cancers obviously have more than one driving mutation or more than one driving pathway. Do you guys look at the potential or do you see the potential with your DTC to deliver more than one trigger? Is that something which you think is feasible? COO and Head of R&D: Yes, we do. And it's certainly feasible. I mean, basically we're doing that right now with ARC-520\\u2026 President and CEO: And also 521. Analyst at Piper Jaffray: Fair enough... COO and Head of R&D: So, sure, it\\u2019s feasible and we think that's something that absolutely could be developed. ARC-HIF2 has been important for us in trying to work out extra-hepatic delivery which you probably know in the field has been extremely difficult. About the only way people have been able to do it up to now has tended to do with liposomes, which are very problematic delivery systems. So, we are targeted delivery, but once we've achieved the kind of profile that we want, I don't see any reason why we couldn't do multiple genes at the same time. Analyst at Piper Jaffray: Okay. Thanks, guys. COO and Head of R&D: You're welcome. Operator: And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Chris Anzalone, CEO of Arrowhead for closing remarks. President and CEO: Thanks everyone for your interest, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter or sooner. Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program.
